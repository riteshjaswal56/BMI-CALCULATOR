        <h1>Path to Improved Health</h1>
        <p>If your BMI calculator results diagnose your health status to be overweight or obese, it's high time to take action right away. You can inculcate the following habits to adjust your BMI to healthy levels:</p>

            <h2>Exercise Regularly</h2>
            <p>Start with short exercises focusing on cardio and weight loss to burn calories and improve your blood circulation. You can also move ahead to muscle-building exercises to lose belly fat and improve your shape. This will help strengthen your body to defend against heart issues and conditions like cholesterol.</p>

            <h2>Eat Healthy Food</h2>
            <p>With exercise, you must also look after your diet and try to cut down your intake of oily and high-calorie-rich foods. Instead, you must focus on a more protein-rich diet by including fruits, lean meat, vegetables, and whole grain items in your meal.</p>

            <h2>Avoid Overeating</h2>
            <p>Dieting can increase your cravings to overeat during cheat days. In such instances, you must be mindful of your portion to allow smooth digestion. This will prevent excess undigested nutrients from getting stored as fats.</p>

        <h1>Alternate Estimates of Weight-Related Health Risks</h1>
        <p>As already discussed, BMI calculators are not always a reliable option for knowing your health status. Instead of BMI, you can use the following alternative methods to track your weight:</p>
        
        <section class="method">
            <h2>1. Waist Circumference</h2>
            <p>Measuring your waist helps to determine fat stored in your body more accurately than BMI. With waist circumference, you can know where most fat in your body is getting stored and whether you are overweight or not.</p>
            <p>If your waist circumference is above 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men, you might run a higher health risk of contracting chronic illnesses. To measure your waist circumference, place a tape around your mid-region, above your hip bones and measure the circumference.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="method">
            <h2>2. Waist-to-Hip Ratio</h2>
            <p>Waist-to-hip ratio is another way for doctors and dieticians to determine whether you are overweight, obese or underweight. To calculate your health status, this ratio takes fats stored around your hips, waist and buttocks into consideration.</p>
            <p>Unlike BMI, waist-to-hip ratio is a comparison between the fat stored around your waist and hips. As per research, people who carry more weight around their waist-hip region tend to be overweight. They stand at high risk of health conditions like type-2 diabetes and other health issues.</p>
            <p>The World Health Organisation states that the ideal waist-to-hip ratio for men is 0.9 or less and for women, it is 0.85 or less.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="method">
            <h2>3. Waist-to-Height Ratio</h2>
            <p>This ratio compares your waist circumference to your height and presents results to reflect fat distribution in your body. According to studies, a person's weight-to-height ratio is a good indicator of their vulnerability to heart attack and other health conditions related to obesity.</p>
            <p>The ideal weight-to-height ratio is 0.50 for both men and women. A ratio above 0.50 indicates that the person is verging towards obesity and will be vulnerable to health issues like diabetes and high cholesterol.</p>
