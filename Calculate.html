            <h1 class="intro" >  Introduction to the Body Mass Index (BMI)</h1>
                <p class="concept">Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used as an indicator of body fat content. Your weight alone is not sufficient to establish if you are in a healthy weight range. For example, a tall but slender person can weigh more than a short but plump individual. But the former may enjoy better health as long as their weight is suitable for their height. The ideal weight is also likely to differ for men and women of similar heights.<br><br>
        
                How then do you know whether you fall in the healthy weight range or not? Your BMI solves this confusion. It correlates your weight with your height and evaluates whether your weight is appropriate for your stature. You can use a BMI calculator to find out your BMI.<br ><br>
                        
                Although not an exact measurement of body fat percentage, in most cases, BMI is a reliable tool for establishing risk levels for illnesses, especially ailments related to excess body fat. Many healthcare professionals use BMI to determine effective doses for medicines. Often people with a higher BMI need higher doses. Hence, it is crucial to be aware of your BMI to ensure your overall wellness. </p>

                <p>
                  If you want to calculate your BMI, you have to find out your weight and height first. Once you know these values, you can arrive at the result by following the two steps mentioned below:
                </p>

                <div class="steps">
                  <div class="step">
                    <span class="step-number">1</span>
                    <p>Multiply your height by itself (height √ó height).</p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="step">
                    <span class="step-number">2</span>
                    <p>Divide your weight by the answer you get in the first step.</p>
                  </div>

BMI calculation for children follows the same formula as adults. But the value is then plotted on standard gender-specific BMI-for-age percentile charts for children.

            <img src="https://www.thefitindian.com/conditions/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Consequences-Of-Overweight.jpg">
            <ul class="health-risks">
                <li>Vitamin deficiencies</li>
                <li>Anaemia (low red blood cell count and hence reduced capacity to carry oxygen)</li>
                <li>Diminished immunity or the ability to ward off infections</li>
                <li>Osteoporosis or brittle bones that break easily</li>
                <li>Malnutrition</li>
                <li>Developmental delays in children</li>
                <li>Hormonal imbalances</li>
                <li>Disruptions in women's menstrual cycle causing complications in conception</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Being underweight can also be an indication of underlying health conditions like anorexia. Hence, if your BMI calculator shows a value matching the underweight category, you should consult a medical professional.</p>

    <div class="Conclusion">
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p class="stress">Due to the elevated stress of today's lifestyle and increased pollution levels, obesity and associated lifestyle diseases are rampant even among the youth. Thus, a BMI calculator in India is a useful tool as it can help you assess your health risks. A medical practitioner can help you understand your BMI's implications and guide you towards healthy life choices to prevent any complications.<br><br>

        However, apart from maintaining a healthy lifestyle, it is also crucial to stay prepared for unexpected health complications. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and the expenses for quality treatment can strain your financial resources. Fortunately, a health insurance policy can safeguard your savings by covering your healthcare expenses. Hence, along with adopting healthy habits, you can also consider investing in a comprehensive health insurance policy. This will secure your family against the financial repercussions of medical exigencies.</p>
